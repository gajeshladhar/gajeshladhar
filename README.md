# 👋 Hi, I’m Gajesh

🧠 **Applied AI Researcher** | 🌐 **Frontier AI & World Models** | 🛰️ **Scalable Vision Systems**

Welcome — I’m Gajesh, an applied AI researcher with **4+ years of hands-on experience in computer vision and large-scale visual systems**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **frontier vision research**, **representation learning**, and **real-world spatial intelligence**.

I focus on **building, training, and evaluating foundation-style vision models**, with a strong emphasis on **self-supervised learning, world models, and scalable inference** — often grounded in high-resolution, large-scale visual data.

<br>

## 🧩 What I Work On

- 🧠 **Frontier Vision Research**  
  Self-Supervised Learning, Representation Learning, World Models, Foundation Vision Backbones

- 🤖 **Applied Computer Vision**  
  Segmentation, Detection, Dense Prediction, Super-Resolution, Vision-Language & Generative Models

- 🌍 **Large-Scale Spatial Systems**  
  Earth Observation, Geospatial Intelligence, Route Optimization, Building & Infrastructure Mapping

- ☁️ **Scalable ML Systems**  
  PyTorch, Dask, Xarray, Distributed Training & Inference, Cloud-native AI (AWS / GCP)

<br>

I care deeply about **signal over noise**, **open research**, and **shipping real systems** — from training large models to releasing datasets, weights, and reproducible code.
